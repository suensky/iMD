## Feature: Main Page & AI Notes Style Refinement

### Summary

- Refresh the main dashboard and AI notes mode to mirror the modern SeaStar reference layout, emphasizing structured surfaces, refined typography, and balanced use of light/dark themes.
- Introduce cohesive styling primitives (colors, spacing, rounded corners, Inter font usage) that apply consistently across navigation, editor, and AI chat panels.
- Elevate interactive elements (buttons, icons, chat composer) with clearer hierarchy, hover states, and accessible contrast in both themes.

### TODO

- [x] Audit existing UI components for the main page and AI notes mode to locate styling entry points (layout scaffolding, Tailwind tokens, shared components).
- [x] Define updated design tokens (colors, typography, spacing, elevations) reflecting the provided reference, ensuring light/dark theme parity.
- [x] Rework the main page layout to incorporate the structured sidebar, top toolbar, and content panels with new spacing and surface treatments.
- [x] Revamp AI notes mode views to adopt the refreshed card, chat, and editor styling, including updated buttons and icons.
- [x] Verify responsiveness and interaction states (hover, focus, disabled) for key controls and confirm no regressions in existing behavior.
- [x] Manually test light and dark modes to validate contrast ratios and visual consistency.
