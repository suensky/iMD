## Feature: Main Page Redesign

### Summary
- Introduce a new main landing page that opens with a central chat canvas.
- Provide a left sidebar (refined to fit the New Chat control) with a clickable SeaStar logo and product name returning to the main page.
- Brand the landing experience as SeaStar using the supplied hero logo.
- Add a “New Chat” button with a rotated plus icon that toggles an always-expanded dropdown menu of subpages/actions by default.
- Include a bottom-aligned user profile button in the sidebar with sign-in, sign-out, and settings options accessible via dropdown.

### TODO
- [x] Draft the layout structure for the sidebar, main chat area, and responsive behavior.
- [x] Implement the sidebar components (logo link, expandable plus menu, profile menu).
- [x] Build the chatbox section within the main content area using existing styling conventions.
- [x] Wire up dropdown visibility toggles with “New Chat” button defaulting to expanded state and ensure accessibility basics (focus/keyboard support).
- [x] Style the page with Tailwind classes to match the provided reference aesthetics.
- [x] Add any necessary TypeScript types or utility helpers to support the new page.
