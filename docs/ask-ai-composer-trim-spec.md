## Summary
- Simplify the Ask AI composer by removing the edit/apply buttons and tweak the textarea size so it matches ChatGPT's single-line default with a small comfort padding.

## TODO
- Strip the edit and apply button controls from the Ask AI chat UI.
- Update the composer styling so the textarea starts at a single line height with slight padding, while still supporting auto-resize.
- Confirm the send icon enable/disable and input clearing behaviors remain unchanged after the layout adjustments.
- Manually verify the updated composer in the UI build.
